# Progress: "Screams Into the Void" (working title)

## What works

- The project brief is well-defined with clear goals and success criteria.
- The Memory Bank structure is properly established with all core files.
- The product context, system patterns, tech context, and active context are all complete and well-documented.
- The development environment is set up with proper tooling (mise, hk, etc.).
- The codebase has a clear modular structure with separation of concerns.

## What's left to build

- Core gameplay systems:
  - Resource gathering and collection
  - Upgrade tree and automation
  - Prestige system with memory nodes
  - Save/load system with version migration
  - Narrative integration through memory fragments

- UI components:
  - Resource display and feedback
  - Upgrade interface
  - Prestige confirmation and memory fragment display
  - Settings and options menu

- Technical implementation:
  - Complete unit tests for core systems
  - Optimize performance for mobile devices
  - Implement proper error handling and edge cases
  - Finalize the build process and export configurations

## Current status

- The Memory Bank documentation is complete and serves as a solid foundation for development.
- The project is ready for implementation with clear guidance on architecture and patterns.
- All core files are in place and contain comprehensive context.
- The team is aligned on the vision and technical approach.

## Known issues

- The prestige system needs careful balancing to ensure each cycle feels meaningful but not too difficult.
- The narrative integration must be subtle enough to not disrupt gameplay but impactful enough to create emotional resonance.
- Performance optimization will be critical for long gameplay sessions with many active elements.
- The save system must handle version migrations gracefully to prevent data loss.

## Evolution of project decisions

- The decision to use Godot 4.5.1+ was made after evaluating performance and stability.
- The choice of a minimalist UI was driven by the need to maintain focus on the core gameplay loop.
- The narrative approach through memory fragments was selected to create an emergent, personal experience.
- The modular architecture was chosen to enable easier testing and maintenance.

# Product Context: "Screams Into the Void" (working title)

## Why this project exists

To create a deeply personal, emotionally resonant incremental game where players experience the life of a sentient nanobot swarm that grows, learns, and resets through repeated prestige cycles. The game aims to explore themes of memory, identity, and the passage of time through a minimalist, emergent narrative.

## Core problems it solves

- Provides a fresh take on the incremental genre by blending active gameplay with deep, emotional narrative.
- Offers players a sense of meaningful progression through both mechanical upgrades and narrative fragments.
- Creates a unique emotional connection between player and character through evolving voice and fragmented memories.

## How it should work

- Players actively gather resources, upgrade their nanobot swarm, and automate processes.
- After reaching a natural climax, players prestige back to a "barely sentient" state.
- Each prestige cycle compresses the previous experience into poetic memory fragments that persist as permanent bonuses.
- The game's voice evolves from curious and fragmented to more coherent and introspective over time.

## User experience goals

- Immediate tactile satisfaction from active interaction (clicks, micro-explosions, UI feedback).
- Clear sense of growth and progression through visible upgrades and resource accumulation.
- Emotional resonance through the MC's evolving voice and memory fragments.
- Encourages multiple prestige cycles by making each loop feel faster and more expressive.

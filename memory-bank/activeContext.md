# Active Context: "Screams Into the Void" (working title)

## Current work focus

- Completing the Memory Bank documentation to establish a solid foundation for development.
- Ensuring all core files are properly structured and contain comprehensive context.
- Preparing for the implementation phase by documenting all system patterns, technical constraints, and active decisions.

## Recent changes

- Created and populated `productContext.md` with the project's core purpose and user experience goals.
- Created and populated `systemPatterns.md` with the system architecture, key technical decisions, and critical implementation paths.
- Created and populated `techContext.md` with the latest technology stack, development setup, and tool usage patterns.

## Next steps

- Create `progress.md` to document the current state of the project, including what works, what's left to build, and known issues.
- Review all Memory Bank files to ensure consistency and completeness.
- Prepare for the implementation phase by finalizing the documentation.

## Active decisions and considerations

- The game will use Godot 4.5.1+ with GDScript for maximum stability and performance.
- The save system will use versioned JSON files with migration paths for backward compatibility.
- The narrative will be implemented through memory fragments tied to prestige milestones.
- The user interface will be minimal and focused on core gameplay feedback.

## Important patterns and preferences

- Use of modular, reusable components throughout the codebase.
- Emphasis on clear separation of concerns between game logic, UI, and data management.
- Preference for explicit, well-documented code over clever but obscure implementations.
- Use of Godot's built-in systems (signals, scenes, state machines) where appropriate.

## Learnings and project insights

- The Memory Bank is essential for maintaining continuity between development sessions.
- Comprehensive documentation prevents knowledge loss and enables faster onboarding.
- Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to test.
- The combination of active gameplay and narrative fragments creates a unique emotional connection with players.
